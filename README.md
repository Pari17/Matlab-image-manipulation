# Matlab-image-manipulation
The matlab files (.m and .mlx files) contain code to perform image manipulation on the provided image (Lena.bmp) using different filters such as Gaussian filter and applying filters using given kernels, using and trial and error method to acquire the right numbers within the kernel to obtain accurate results. 
Furthermore, manipulating images to turn them into grayscale, find edges, and sharpen images using different methods. 

Note: The .mlx file can not be opened on github and must be downloaded as it is a live editor that includes the indivial code section output. However, the code available in the .m file is identical and can be viewed on this platform.
